title: Token Completeness Checklist
purpose: Authoritative list of token categories the compliance-pre-check agent verifies. The design-system gate refuses to complete until every required category is satisfied.
---

# Token Completeness Checklist

This is the canonical gate. `agents/compliance-pre-check.md` runs against this list. Every **required** category must be fully present before the gate passes. **Optional** categories are noted — include them if relevant to the project.

Values are never dictated here — they vary per project. This checklist concerns **category coverage**, not specific values.

---

## Surface Colors (required)

Every token below must have a light-mode value AND a dark-mode value.

| Token | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `--background` | Page/app background |
| `--foreground` | Default text on background |
| `--card` | Card surface background |
| `--card-foreground` | Text on card |
| `--popover` | Popover/dropdown background |
| `--popover-foreground` | Text on popover |

---

## Brand Colors (required)

Every token below must have a light-mode value AND a dark-mode value.

Additional chart tokens (`--chart-6` and beyond) are optional. Each chart token must have light-mode and dark-mode values.

---

## Sidebar Tokens (required IF project has an app shell)

If the project includes a persistent sidebar, navigation drawer, or app shell layout — these tokens are required. If it is a marketing-only site or a layout without a sidebar, this entire category may be omitted.

---

## Typography — Font Families (required)

| Token | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--font-sans` | Yes | Primary sans-serif stack |

| `--font-display` | Optional | Display/headline variant |
| `--font-logo` | Optional | Logotype or wordmark font |

---

## Typography — Type Scale (required — pick ONE approach and document)

Choose either **size tokens** or **semantic tokens** — do not mix. Document the decision in `docs/design-system.md`.

**Option A — Size tokens** (numeric scale):

| Token | Size |
| --- | --- |
| `--text-xs` | 12px equivalent |
| `--text-sm` | 14px equivalent |
| `--text-base` | 16px equivalent |
| `--text-lg` | 18px equivalent |
| `--text-xl` | 20px equivalent |
| `--text-2xl` | 24px equivalent |
| `--text-3xl` | 30px equivalent |
| `--text-4xl` | 36px equivalent |

**Option B — Semantic tokens** (role-named scale):

| Token | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `--text-caption` | Smallest, labels/metadata |
| `--text-body-sm` | Compact body |
| `--text-body` | Default body |
| `--text-body-lg` | Emphasized body |
| `--text-heading-sm` | Section heading |
| `--text-heading` | Page heading |
| `--text-heading-lg` | Hero heading |
| `--text-display` | Marketing/hero display |

---

## Typography — Weights, Leading, Tracking (required)

Document the full scale even if mapping to Tailwind defaults. Must be in `docs/design-system.md`.

| Category | Required entries |
| --- | --- |
| Font weights | At minimum: regular (400), medium (500), semibold (600), bold (700) |
| Line heights (leading) | At minimum: tight, normal, relaxed |
| Letter spacing (tracking) | At minimum: tight, normal, wide |

---

## Radius (required)

| Token | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `--radius` | Base radius value |
| `--radius-sm` | Small radius (inputs, tags) |
| `--radius-md` | Medium radius (cards, modals) |
| `--radius-lg` | Large radius (panels) |
| `--radius-xl` | Extra-large radius |
| `--radius-pill` | Fully rounded ends (badges, pills) |
| `--radius-full` | Circle (avatars, icons) |

---

## Spacing (required)

Tailwind's default 4px-base spacing scale is acceptable. If using it, record that decision explicitly in `docs/design-system.md` under "Spacing Decision." If using a custom scale, document the full scale with values.

---

## Shadows (required)

| Token | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `--shadow-sm` | Subtle lift (inputs, micro-elements) |
| `--shadow-md` | Card elevation |
| `--shadow-lg` | Dropdown, popover |
| `--shadow-xl` | Modal, drawer |
| `--shadow-2xl` | Maximum elevation (lightbox, command palette) |

Brand-specific shadows (e.g., `--shadow-brand`, `--shadow-glow`) are optional. Document them if used.

---

## Motion (required)

| Category | Required entries |
| --- | --- |
| Duration scale | At minimum: fast (≤150ms), normal (200–300ms), slow (400–500ms) |
| Easing curves | At minimum: default (ease), in, out, spring/bounce |

Document as CSS custom properties (e.g., `--duration-fast: 150ms`) OR as Tailwind theme extensions. Either form is acceptable; document the choice.

---

## Breakpoints (required)

Document the breakpoint scale in `docs/design-system.md`. Tailwind defaults are acceptable — record that decision. Custom breakpoints must list each name and pixel value.

Minimum breakpoints to document: `sm` (640px), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px), `xl` (1280px), `2xl` (1536px).

---

## Z-index (required)

Document a layered z-index scale in `docs/design-system.md`. Values must be named by layer, not arbitrary numbers.

Example layer names (adapt to project): `base`, `raised`, `dropdown`, `sticky`, `overlay`, `modal`, `toast`, `tooltip`.

---

## Dark Mode (required)

Every **color token** must have both a light-mode value and a dark-mode value. No exceptions.

Implementation: use CSS custom properties scoped to `.dark` (or `[data-theme="dark"]`) — either via Tailwind's `darkMode: 'class'` strategy or an equivalent. Document the strategy in `docs/design-system.md`.

**Compliance check:** `compliance-pre-check` will flag any color token that appears in `:root` but has no corresponding dark variant.

---

## Gate Rule

`compliance-pre-check` returns `status: pass` only when:

1. All **required** categories above are covered
2. All **conditional** categories (sidebar) are covered if their condition is met
3. Every color token has both a light and dark variant
4. The type scale approach (Option A or B) is documented in `docs/design-system.md`
5. Spacing and breakpoint decisions are documented (even if using Tailwind defaults)

Partial satisfaction of any required category = `status: fail` with a list of the specific missing tokens.
